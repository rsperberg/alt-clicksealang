<!ENTITY para.bitext.2.2     " Bitexts can markedly increase student reading and comprehension in a second language. Because the raw volume of text they read jumps so dramatically, students are exposed to a much wider vocabulary. Moreover, when text is easier to read, students can begin to understand large-scale features of style and grammar. Bitexts have long been a mainstay of second-language education for European languages and are equally valuable for students of English and Southeast Asian languages.">
<!ENTITY para.bitext.3.1     "Bitext search tools are a cornerstone of data-driven learning. Calling up a dozen examples of a word, phrase, or construction helps students understand and retain subtle distinctions of meaning and usage.

<!ENTITY para.bitext.4.2     " Bitexts are an essential part of research in translation, word-sense disambiguation, and lexicography.
